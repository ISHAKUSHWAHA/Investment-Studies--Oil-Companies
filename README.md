# Investment-Studies--Oil-Companies
Analyzes the impact of crude oil price changes on Indian oil stocks (IOC, ONGC, OIL) using Excel dashboards with ROI, volatility, and gain/loss metrics across Pre-War, Shock, and Post-Shock periods.

This project analyzes the relationship between **crude oil prices** and the stock prices of key Indian oil refinery companies: **IOC**, **ONGC**, and **Oil India Ltd**, across three geopolitical phases:

-  **Pre-War** (Jan 2021 – Feb 23, 2022)
-  **Shock** (Feb 24, 2022 – Dec 30, 2022)
-  **Post-Shock** (Dec 31, 2022 – Dec 31, 2023)

##  Purpose

- To **establish correlation** between crude oil and Indian oil stocks.
- To **test an investment strategy** using oil price signals for stock entry/exit.
- To quantify **gain/loss**, **ROI**, and **volatility** across turbulent and stable phases.
- To demonstrate findings using an **interactive Excel dashboard**.

##  Key Analysis Performed

-  **Correlation & Slope Analysis**: Measured how closely each stock tracks crude oil and how sensitive it is to changes.
-  **Regression**: Calculated slope to estimate price responsiveness.
-  **ROI & Gain/Loss Simulation**: Hypothetical trade batches built crude oil prices.
-  **Volatility Tracking**: Compared price volatility across phases using standard deviation.
-  **Trend Reversal Analysis**: Observed decoupling of crude oil vs. stock prices post-Oct 2023.

##  Key Findings

- **Best Performing Stock (ROI Overall):** `OI Ltd` – 25.94% average ROI  
- **Worst Performing Stock:** `IOC` – 8.68% average ROI  
- **Least Volatile Stock:** `IOC` – 8.68 (avg volatility)  
- **Most Volatile Stock:** `OI Ltd` – 22.82  
- The **Shock** period showed breakdown in correlation due to Russia-Ukraine War
- Post-shock, crude oil declined while share prices rose — attributed to improved retail margins and tax policy shifts.
